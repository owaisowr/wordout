    <p>The biggest problems in the communication domain have been unavailability of easy and fast communication channels within organizations. The purpose of this project is to provide convenient, fast and easy one- way communication (one to many) between concerned people.</p>
           <p>It can have a large scale implementation in areas where communication gap is a big concern Government offices, colleges, factories, etc. The best use can be sharing of notices, schedules and other relevant information.</p>
         <p>At present, there are no convenient formal means of communication between people of different ranks. Therefore, this project is concerned to solve this problem. A person who needs to broadcast, can easily create his/her unique broadcast ID and can circulate it to those whom he/she wants to share the concerned notices with. Similarly, with this ID only, a person can easily see what all notices are there related to him/her.
